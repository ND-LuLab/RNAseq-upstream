To pull human or mouse reference genome (from Ensembl), run:

./pullRef_human.sh

Or

./pullRef_mouse.sh


If using STAR the first time, please index the reference genome by running:

./buildIndex.sh 

OR with the following command:

STAR --runThreadN 16 \ # number of threads
     --runMode genomeGenerate \ 
     --genomeDir genome \ # replace with actual directory
     --genomeFastaFiles genomic.fa\ # genome fasta file
     --sjdbGTFfile genomic.gtf \ # in the .gtf/.gff3 format
     --sjdbOverhang 100 # ideally max read length-1; default 100

Note that building the genome index could take a long time. The scripts are compatible with CRC job submission through `qsub buildIndex.sh`. Please fill in your email address in the script header to receive notifications about job status.
